## Local Development and Testing

To set up a local development environment on Ubuntu:

+--------------------+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------+
| Step               | Command                             | Comment                     |
+--------------------+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------+
| 1) Install Ruby    | > sudo apt-get install ruby         | installs Ruby 1.9.3         |
| 2) Install Bundler | > sudo apt-get install ruby-bundler | note [1]                    |
| 3) Install Gems    | > bundle install                    | loads everything in Gemfile |
| 4) Run the app     | > bin/run                           | runs the app on port 4567   |
+--------------------+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------+

note [1]
- May be accomplished with "sudo gem install bundler" instead, but this is discouraged.
- might run this without `sudo`
- this installs all the support software in the `Gemfile`
